/**

 *
 *   GET /api/community/threads            — returns all community threads
 *   GET /api/community/threads?category=NOC — filtered by category
 *
 * Uses the native MongoDB driver (ConnectDB from mongoClient.ts) to query the
 * `community` collection in the `samagama` database — the collection seeded by
 * src/lib/db/seedCommunity.ts. Each document is a full Thread, including its
 * nested `replies` array.
 *
 * Response shape:
 *   { ok: true, threads: Thread[] }
 *
 * Thread document schema (from DB):
 *   { id, question, category, originalAuthor, authorRole, initialAnswer,
 *     answeredBy, answeredByRole, createdAt, resolvedAt, views, status,
 *     replies: Reply[] }
